# Assessing_WHO_Mortality_Database
This project was completed as part of my MSc module, Python for Programming and Health Research. The WHO Mortality Database is a datasource used for comparative epidemiological studies. The database is comprised of files describing each country's population and number of deaths by sex, age, cause, and year from 1950 to 2020.The aim of this assessment was to review the WHO mortality data with particular attention paid to COVID-19 mortality.
